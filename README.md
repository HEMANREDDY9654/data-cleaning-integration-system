# Automated Data Cleaning, Standardization & Integration System

## Problem Statement
Organizations collect data from multiple heterogeneous sources such as databases, APIs, and spreadsheets.
These data sources often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, duplicate records, and schema mismatches,
which reduce the reliability of analytics and machine learning models.

## Proposed Solution
This project proposes an automated data preprocessing system that:
- Cleans missing and invalid data
- Standardizes formats across datasets
- Removes duplicate records
- Integrates data from multiple sources into a unified structure

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- MySQL / PostgreSQL

## Future Scope
- Real-time data pipeline integration
- AI-based anomaly detection
- Dashboard for data quality monitoring
- Cloud deployment
